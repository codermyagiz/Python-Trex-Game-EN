## Using:
If the bot doesn't work properly on your device, you have to enter the necessary values and coordinates for your own computer.

I'll show you this part as soon as possible.

## Notice:

The ImageGrab module I used in the project is only available on windows.
It does not work on Linux, macOs and other os. So, the project only works on Windows.
